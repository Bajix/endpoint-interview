## The problem

A common method of organizing files on a computer is to store them in hierarchical directories. For instance:

```
photos/
  birthdays/
    joe/
    mary/
  vacations/
  weddings/
```

In this challenge, you will implement commands that allow a user to create, move and delete directories.

A successful solution will take the following input:

```
CREATE fruits
CREATE vegetables
CREATE grains
CREATE fruits/apples
CREATE fruits/apples/fuji
LIST
CREATE grains/squash
MOVE grains/squash vegetables
CREATE foods
MOVE grains foods
MOVE fruits foods
MOVE vegetables foods
LIST
DELETE fruits/apples
DELETE foods/fruits/apples
LIST
```

and produce the following output

```
CREATE fruits
CREATE vegetables
CREATE grains
CREATE fruits/apples
CREATE fruits/apples/fuji
LIST
fruits
  apples
    fuji
grains
vegetables
CREATE grains/squash
MOVE grains/squash vegetables
CREATE foods
MOVE grains foods
MOVE fruits foods
MOVE vegetables foods
LIST
foods
  fruits
    apples
      fuji
  grains
  vegetables
    squash
DELETE fruits/apples
Cannot delete fruits/apples - fruits does not exist
DELETE foods/fruits/apples
LIST
foods
  fruits
  grains
  vegetables
    squash
```

## Helpful hints

You should **not** implement a program that actually
creates folders on the host machine.

You **should** implement a program that takes the above input (either hard-coded
into your program, or reading it from a file) and produces exactly the output
shown above.

While it may be tempting to use helper libraries to solve this challenge, that
would not show us the skillset we are interested in. Please do your own work
to implement the solution we describe.
